**The Flow**

This will be our weekly activity to contribute and give back to the Tech Community. The flow overall flow will be as bellow

Question -> Assign (PO+Trieu) -> Anwer (PIC) -> Review (Reviewer) -> Shout out to the community (PO)

Each week, every team will pick 1 Team Member as PIC (to answer the question) and 1 Reviewer (to review the answer, just to make sure :) )

Each question will be assigned to a Team based on the given "Tag":
- Backend -> Backend Team
- Mobile -> Mobile Team
- Frontend -> Fullstack Team
- Test/ Quality Assurance -> QA Team
- Overall Question on Tech -> Trieu to Assign to a suitable team.
- About Manabie -> People Team

**Timeline**
Every team member will have 30-45 mins session on Thursday to answer the questions assigned. (Number of questions answer per week to be decided)

How I think we should decide the number of questions each week: Reviewer to check the questions assigned, and rate the questions from 1 to 5 point in term of difficulty. Each week, PIC will need to finish a certain points to be concidered "Finish".

-> The problem:
- Lots of workload!
- Point will be given based on the Reviewer perspective, so it could be bias.
